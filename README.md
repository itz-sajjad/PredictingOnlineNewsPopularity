# PredictingOnlineNewsPopularity

Utilizing machine learning algorithms, we developed a predictive model with 79% accuracy to forecast the popularity of online news articles on Mashable. Additionally, leveraging a cost matrix, we projected a profitability of $1,182,400 for the model.

Problem Statement:
The dataset comprises articles published by Mashable over a two-year period. Mashable aims to predict which articles will become popular based on historical data and set optimal advertisement prices accordingly.

Project Goal:
Our objective is to accurately predict whether an article will achieve high popularity based on social media sharing metrics. We pursued this goal through comprehensive data engineering and the application of various machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective predictive model within the dataset.
